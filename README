Ontology-Enhanced Subreddit Classifier
An intelligent text classification system that leverages semantic ontologies to categorize Reddit posts into appropriate subreddits with detailed explanations.
Overview
This project implements a hybrid approach to text classification by combining traditional machine learning techniques with a rich semantic ontology. The system can classify Reddit posts into five major categories (technology, science, gaming, fitness, and movies) while providing transparent reasoning for its decisions.
Key Features

Semantic Ontology Framework: Hierarchical knowledge representation with categories, subgroups, concepts, and synonyms
Multi-method Approach: Combines TF-IDF, graph-based features, and word embeddings
Explainable Classifications: Visual and textual explanations showing which terms influenced decisions
Interactive Interface: Real-time classification with detailed evidence paths
BERT Enhancement: Alternative implementation using BERT for improved semantic understanding
